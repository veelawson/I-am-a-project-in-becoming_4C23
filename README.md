#I am...A Project in Becoming

This coding tool is a great way to break the ice at begining of your school year. Why not use code to help your students introduce themselves? It's also an easy way for you to introduce your students to a little bit of computer science and build their coding literacy.

This template also allows the user to mix and match div. blocks should students wish to further customize their work. It's a great introduction to coding that will allow them to use our other tools found: [HERE](http://pitt.edu/~sjq4/PittFuego/#Introductions)

    
## Get started!

1. Create a GitHub account. 

2. Go to the I-am-a-project-in-becoming  repository: [HERE](https://github.com/sjquigley/I-am-a-project-in-becoming) 

3. Click "Code": Download ZIP to local computer. 

4. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and where you will organize your other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

5. Download and/or open a text editor like [brackets.io](https://brackets.io), [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

6. Use the text editor to open the style.css and index.html documents from your project folder.  

7. Start by reading the index.html in text editor where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

8. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, return to your GitHub page and create a new repository. Click  upload (push) your files. Upload, then hit "Commit!" 

9. Go to repository settings, scroll down to Github pages, change setting from "none" to "main."  

10. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

11. Test the URL. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
